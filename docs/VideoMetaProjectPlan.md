# Stupidly Simplistic Yet Clear... Project Outline

## 1. Why, Who, and Value
 
	•	Why: Automating and enriching video metadata significantly reduces manual effort, improves accuracy, and accelerates content monetization.
	•	Who: Aimed at stock footage creators, digital asset managers, and content platforms.
	•	Value: Streamlined workflow, improved metadata quality, increased sales opportunities, and scalable asset management.

## 2. User Stories (10-15)
 
	1.	As a creator, I want metadata automatically generated for my videos so I save time.
	2.	As an asset manager, I need batches of video metadata enriched quickly.
	3.	As a developer, I want clear APIs for easy integration.
	4.	As a reviewer, I want easy-to-review and modify metadata outputs.
	5.	As a content publisher, I require metadata formatted in standardized XML.
	6.	As a user, I want AI-generated keywords and captions.
	7.	As a curator, I want clear notifications when metadata generation completes.
	8.	As a content marketer, I want metadata tailored to maximize search engine visibility.
	9.	As a user, I need video artifact state clearly tracked through processing stages.
	10.	As a developer, I require robust error handling and clear logging.
	11.	As a user, I want metadata history preserved for auditing.
	12.	As a content manager, I need batch artifacts easily manageable.
	13.	As an operator, I need quick, visual feedback on metadata generation progress.
	14.	As a platform admin, I want detailed usage analytics.
	15.	As a mobile user, I need basic metadata interaction and status updates.

## 3. Data Models
 
	•	VideoArtifact
	•	ID, filename, filepath
	•	Enriched metadata: caption, keywords, scene type, actions, OCR text
	•	Status: pending, processing, completed, error
	•	BatchArtifact
	•	ID, timestamp, videos[]
	•	Status: initiated, processing, completed, error
	•	VideoProxy
	•	Video ID, URL, status
	•	Lightweight metadata summary for quick access

## 4. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
 
	•	Upload video batch
	•	AI metadata enrichment (keywords, description, caption, OCR)
	•	Export enriched metadata in XML
	•	Visual status dashboard

## 6. Future Vision
 
	•	Integration with major content distribution networks
	•	Enhanced AI-driven metadata refinement (ML model improvements)
	•	User-defined metadata customization workflows
	•	Mobile integration for metadata monitoring and basic management
	•	Predictive analytics for content performance

## 7. Drill-Down Components
 
	•	Metadata Pipeline: LangChain, Whisper, SpaCy, YOLO
	•	API Service: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, MinIO, Weaviate
	•	UI: React, MUI, simple REST-driven interactions
	•	Storage: Object (MinIO), vector (Weaviate)

## 8. Chosen Tech Stack
 
	•	Backend: Python, FastAPI, LangChain, Whisper, SpaCy, YOLO
	•	AI: OpenAI (GPT), HuggingFace Transformers
	•	Storage: MinIO, Weaviate
	•	Frontend: React, Material UI
	•	Deployment: Docker, Docker Compose (GPU and CPU variants)

## 9. Development Process
 
	•	Planning & Specs: Define clearly documented user stories & data models
	•	Prototype & Validation: Build minimal UI/API prototypes
	•	Implementation: Iterative development, API first
	•	Testing: Automated (pytest), Integration, End-to-end
	•	Deployment: Docker Compose initially, Kubernetes as project matures
	•	Feedback Loop: Regular reviews with users, refinement, and rapid iteration
