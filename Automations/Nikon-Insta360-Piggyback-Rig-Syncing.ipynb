The function converts an input image from one color space to another. In case of a transformation\n        .   to-from RGB color space, the order of the channels should be specified explicitly (RGB or BGR). Note\n        .   that the default color format in OpenCV is often referred to as RGB but it is actually BGR (the\n        .   bytes are reversed). So the first byte in a standard (24-bit) color image will be an 8-bit Blue\n        .   component, the second byte will be Green, and the third byte will be Red. The fourth, fifth, and\n        .   sixth bytes would then be the second pixel (Blue, then Green, then Red), and so on.\n        .   \n        .   The conventional ranges for R, G, and B channel values are:\n        .   -   0 to 255 for CV_8U images\n        .   -   0 to 65535 for CV_16U images\n        .   -   0 to 1 for CV_32F images\n        .   \n        .   In case of linear transformations, the range does not matter. But in case of a non-linear\n        .   transformation, an input RGB image should be normalized to the proper value range to get the correct\n        .   results, for example, for RGB \\f$\\rightarrow\\f$ L\\*u\\*v\\* transformation. For example, if you have a\n        .   32-bit floating-point image directly converted from an 8-bit image without any scaling, then it will\n        .   have the 0..255 value range instead of 0..1 assumed by the function. So, before calling #cvtColor ,\n        .   you need first to scale the image down:\n        .   @code\n        .       img *= 1./255;\n        .       cvtColor(img, img, COLOR_BGR2Luv);\n        .   @endcode\n        .   If you use #cvtColor with 8-bit images, the conversion will have some information lost.

Although the thorough discussion and justification of the algorithm involved may be found in\n        .   @cite ChambolleEtAl, it might make sense to skim over it here, following @cite MA13 . To begin\n        .   with, we consider the 1-byte gray-level images as the functions from the rectangular domain of\n        .   pixels (it may be seen as set\n        .   \\f$\\left\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{N}\\times\\mathbb{N}\\mid 1\\leq x\\leq n,\\;1\\leq y\\leq m\\right\\}\\f$ for some\n        .   \\f$m,\\;n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\f$) into \\f$\\{0,1,\\dots,255\\}\\f$.

If we treat \\f$x\\f$ as a function, this is\n        .   exactly the functional what we seek to minimize and here the Primal-Dual algorithm comes into play.\n        .   \n        .   @param observations This array should contain one or more noised versions of the image that is to\n        .   be restored.\n        .   @param result Here the denoised image will be stored.

To optimize this sample, consider the following approaches:\n        .   -   Since nonzeroRows != 0 is passed to the forward transform calls and since A and B are copied to\n        .       the top-left corners of tempA and tempB, respectively, it is not necessary to clear the whole\n        .       tempA and tempB. It is only necessary to clear the tempA.cols - A.cols ( tempB.cols - B.cols)\n        .       rightmost columns of the matrices.\n        .   -   This DFT-based convolution does not have to be applied to the whole big arrays, especially if B\n        .       is significantly smaller than A or vice versa. Instead, you can calculate convolution by parts.\n        .       To do this, you need to split the output array C into multiple tiles. For each tile, estimate\n        .       which parts of A and B are required to calculate convolution in this tile. If the tiles in C are\n        .       too small, the speed will decrease a lot because of repeated work. In the ultimate case, when\n        .       each tile in C is a single pixel, the algorithm becomes equivalent to the naive convolution\n        .       algorithm. If the tiles are too big, the temporary arrays tempA and tempB become too big and\n        .       there is also a slowdown because of bad cache locality. So, there is an optimal tile size\n        .       somewhere in the middle.\n        .   -   If different tiles in C can be calculated in parallel and, thus, the convolution is done by\n        .       parts, the loop can be threaded.\n        .   \n        .   All of the above improvements have been implemented in #matchTemplate and #filter2D . Therefore, by\n        .   using them, you can get the performance even better than with the above theoretically optimal\n        .   implementation. Though, those two functions actually calculate cross-correlation, not convolution,\n        .   so you need to \"flip\" the second convolution operand B vertically and horizontally using flip .\n        .   @note\n        .   -   An example using the discrete fourier transform can be found at\n        .       opencv_source_code/samples/cpp/dft.cpp\n        .   -   (Python) An example using the dft functionality to perform Wiener deconvolution can be found\n        .       at opencv_source/samples/python/deconvolution.py\n        .   -   (Python) An example rearranging the quadrants of a Fourier image can be found at\n        .       opencv_source/samples/python/dft.py\n        .   @param src input array that could be real or complex.\n        .   @param dst output array whose size and type depends on the flags .\n        .   @param flags transformation flags, representing a combination of the #DftFlags\n        .   @param nonzeroRows when the parameter is not zero, the function assumes that only the first\n        .   nonzeroRows rows of the input array (#DFT_INVERSE is not set) or only the first nonzeroRows of the\n        .   output array (#DFT_INVERSE is set) contain non-zeros, thus, the function can handle the rest of the\n        .   rows more efficiently and save some time; this technique is very useful for calculating array\n        .   cross-correlation or convolution using DFT.\n        .   @sa dct, getOptimalDFTSize, mulSpectrums, filter2D, matchTemplate, flip, cartToPolar,\n        .   magnitude, phase\n    \n    dilate(...)\n        dilate(src, kernel[, dst[, anchor[, iterations[, borderType[, borderValue]]]]]) -> dst\n        .   @brief Dilates an image by using a specific structuring element.\n        .   \n        .

When maskSize == #DIST_MASK_PRECISE and distanceType == #DIST_L2 , the function runs the\n        .   algorithm described in @cite Felzenszwalb04 . This algorithm is parallelized with the TBB library.\n        .   \n        .   In other cases, the algorithm @cite Borgefors86 is used. This means that for a pixel the function\n        .   finds the shortest path to the nearest zero pixel consisting of basic shifts: horizontal, vertical,\n        .   diagonal, or knight's move (the latest is available for a \\f$5\\times 5\\f$ mask). The overall\n        .   distance is calculated as a sum of these basic distances. Since the distance function should be\n        .   symmetric, all of the horizontal and vertical shifts must have the same cost (denoted as a ), all\n        .   the diagonal shifts must have the same cost (denoted as `b`), and all knight's moves must have the\n        .   same cost (denoted as `c`). For the #DIST_C and #DIST_L1 types, the distance is calculated\n        .   precisely, whereas for #DIST_L2 (Euclidean distance) the distance can be calculated only with a\n        .   relative error (a \\f$5\\times 5\\f$ mask gives more accurate results).

Typically, for a fast, coarse distance estimation #DIST_L2, a \\f$3\\times 3\\f$ mask is used. For a\n        .   more accurate distance estimation #DIST_L2, a \\f$5\\times 5\\f$ mask or the precise algorithm is used.\n        .   Note that both the precise and the approximate algorithms are linear on the number of pixels.\n        .   \n        .   This variant of the function does not only compute the minimum distance for each pixel \\f$(x, y)\\f$\n        .   but also identifies the nearest connected component consisting of zero pixels\n        .

The Method is based on the paper\n        .   @cite duda2018 \"Accurate Detection and Localization of Checkerboard Corners for\n        .

These oversized patterns allow more accurate calibrations as corners can be\n        .   utilized, which are as close as possible to the image borders.  For a\n        .   consistent coordinate system across all images, the optional marker (see image\n        .   below) can be used to move the origin of the board to the location where the\n        .   black circle is located.\n        .   \n        .   @note The function requires a white boarder with roughly the same width as one\n        .   of the checkerboard fields around the whole board to improve the detection in\n        .   various environments.

The\n        .   pixel at \\f$(x,y)\\f$ is considered to belong to the repainted domain if:\n        .   \n        .   - in case of a grayscale image and floating range\n        .   \\f[\\texttt{src} (x',y')- \\texttt{loDiff} \\leq \\texttt{src} (x,y)  \\leq \\texttt{src} (x',y')+ \\texttt{upDiff}\\f]\n        .   \n        .   \n        .   - in case of a grayscale image and fixed range\n        .   \\f[\\texttt{src} ( \\texttt{seedPoint} .x, \\texttt{seedPoint} .y)- \\texttt{loDiff} \\leq \\texttt{src} (x,y)  \\leq \\texttt{src} ( \\texttt{seedPoint} .x, \\texttt{seedPoint} .y)+ \\texttt{upDiff}\\f]\n        .   \n        .   \n        .   - in case of a color image and floating range\n        .   \\f[\\texttt{src} (x',y')_r- \\texttt{loDiff} _r \\leq \\texttt{src} (x,y)_r \\leq \\texttt{src} (x',y')_r+ \\texttt{upDiff} _r,\\f]\n        .   \\f[\\texttt{src} (x',y')_g- \\texttt{loDiff} _g \\leq \\texttt{src} (x,y)_g \\leq \\texttt{src} (x',y')_g+ \\texttt{upDiff} _g\\f]\n        .   and\n        .   \\f[\\texttt{src} (x',y')_b- \\texttt{loDiff} _b \\leq \\texttt{src} (x,y)_b \\leq \\texttt{src} (x',y')_b+ \\texttt{upDiff} _b\\f]\n        .   \n        .   \n        .   - in case of a color image and fixed range\n        .   \\f[\\texttt{src} ( \\texttt{seedPoint} .x, \\texttt{seedPoint} .y)_r- \\texttt{loDiff} _r \\leq \\texttt{src} (x,y)_r \\leq \\texttt{src} ( \\texttt{seedPoint} .x, \\texttt{seedPoint} .y)_r+ \\texttt{upDiff} _r,\\f]\n        .   \\f[\\texttt{src} ( \\texttt{seedPoint} .x, \\texttt{seedPoint} .y)_g- \\texttt{loDiff} _g \\leq \\texttt{src} (x,y)_g \\leq \\texttt{src} ( \\texttt{seedPoint} .x, \\texttt{seedPoint} .y)_g+ \\texttt{upDiff} _g\\f]\n        .   and\n        .   \\f[\\texttt{src} ( \\texttt{seedPoint} .x, \\texttt{seedPoint} .y)_b- \\texttt{loDiff} _b \\leq \\texttt{src} (x,y)_b \\leq \\texttt{src} ( \\texttt{seedPoint} .x, \\texttt{seedPoint} .y)_b+ \\texttt{upDiff} _b\\f]\n        .   \n        .   \n        .   where \\f$src(x',y')\\f$ is the value of one of pixel neighbors that is already known to belong to the\n        .   component. That is, to be added to the connected component, a color/brightness of the pixel should\n        .   be close enough to:\n        .   - Color/brightness of one of its neighbors that already belong to the connected component in case\n        .   of a floating range.\n        .   - Color/brightness of the seed point in case of a fixed range.\n        .   \n        .   Use these functions to either mark a connected component with the specified color in-place, or build\n        .   a mask and then extract the contour, or copy the region to another image, and so on.\n        .   \n        .   @param image Input/output 1- or 3-channel, 8-bit, or floating-point image. It is modified by the\n        .   function unless the #FLOODFILL_MASK_ONLY flag is set in the second variant of the function. See\n        .   the details below.\n        .   @param mask Operation mask that should be a single-channel 8-bit image, 2 pixels wider and 2 pixels\n        .   taller than image. If an empty Mat is passed it will be created automatically. Since this is both an\n        .   input and output parameter, you must take responsibility of initializing it.\n        .   Flood-filling cannot go across non-zero pixels in the input mask. For example,\n        .   an edge detector output can be used as a mask to stop filling at edges. On output, pixels in the\n        .   mask corresponding to filled pixels in the image are set to 1 or to the specified value in flags\n        .   as described below. Additionally, the function fills the border of the mask with ones to simplify\n        .   internal processing. It is therefore possible to use the same mask in multiple calls to the function\n        .   to make sure the filled areas do not overlap.\n        .   @param seedPoint Starting point.\n        .   @param newVal New value of the repainted domain pixels.\n        .   @param loDiff Maximal lower brightness/color difference between the currently observed pixel and\n        .   one of its neighbors belonging to the component, or a seed pixel being added to the component.\n        .   @param upDiff Maximal upper brightness/color difference between the currently observed pixel and\n        .   one of its neighbors belonging to the component, or a seed pixel being added to the component.\n        .   @param rect Optional output parameter set by the function to the minimum bounding rectangle of the\n        .   repainted domain.\n        .   @param flags Operation flags. The first 8 bits contain a connectivity value. The default value of\n        .   4 means that only the four nearest neighbor pixels (those that share an edge) are considered. A\n        .   connectivity value of 8 means that the eight nearest neighbor pixels (those that share a corner)\n        .   will be considered. The next 8 bits (8-16) contain a value between 1 and 255 with which to fill\n        .   the mask (the default value is 1). For example, 4 | ( 255 \\<\\< 8 ) will consider 4 nearest\n        .   neighbours and fill the mask with a value of 255. The following additional options occupy higher\n        .   bits and therefore may be further combined with the connectivity and mask fill values using\n        .   bit-wise or (|), see #FloodFillFlags.\n        .   \n        .   @note Since the mask is larger than the filled image, a pixel \\f$(x, y)\\f$ in image corresponds to the\n        .   pixel \\f$(x+1, y+1)\\f$ in the mask .\n        .   \n        .   @sa findContours\n    \n    gemm(...)\n        gemm(src1, src2, alpha, src3, beta[, dst[, flags]]) -> dst\n        .   @brief Performs generalized matrix multiplication.\n        .   \n        .   The function cv::gemm performs generalized matrix multiplication similar to the\n        .   gemm functions in BLAS level 3.

The function returns the current number of CPU ticks on some architectures (such as x86, x64,\n        .   PowerPC). On other platforms the function is equivalent to getTickCount. It can also be used for\n        .   very accurate time measurements, as well as for RNG initialization. Note that in case of multi-CPU\n        .   systems a thread, from which getCPUTickCount is called, can be suspended and resumed at another CPU\n        .   with its own counter. So, theoretically (and practically) the subsequent calls to the function do\n        .   not necessary return the monotonously increasing values. Also, since a modern CPU varies the CPU\n        .   frequency depending on the load, the number of CPU clocks spent in some code cannot be directly\n        .   converted to time units. Therefore, getTickCount is generally a preferable solution for measuring\n        .   execution time.\n    \n    getDefaultNewCameraMatrix(...)\n        getDefaultNewCameraMatrix(cameraMatrix[, imgsize[, centerPrincipalPoint]]) -> retval\n        .   @brief Returns the default new camera matrix.\n        .   \n        .

The function estimates the transformation between two cameras making a stereo pair. If one computes\n        .   the poses of an object relative to the first camera and to the second camera,\n        .   ( \\f$R_1\\f$,\\f$T_1\\f$ ) and (\\f$R_2\\f$,\\f$T_2\\f$), respectively, for a stereo camera where the\n        .   relative position and orientation between the two cameras are fixed, then those poses definitely\n        .   relate to each other. This means, if the relative position and orientation (\\f$R\\f$,\\f$T\\f$) of the\n        .   two cameras is known, it is possible to compute (\\f$R_2\\f$,\\f$T_2\\f$) when (\\f$R_1\\f$,\\f$T_1\\f$) is\n        .   given. This is what the described function does. It computes (\\f$R\\f$,\\f$T\\f$) such that:\n        .   \n        .   \\f[R_2=R R_1\\f]\n        .   \\f[T_2=R T_1 + T.\\f]\n        .   \n        .

Optionally, it computes the essential matrix E:\n        .   \n        .   \\f[E= \\vecthreethree{0}{-T_2}{T_1}{T_2}{0}{-T_0}{-T_1}{T_0}{0} R\\f]\n        .   \n        .   where \\f$T_i\\f$ are components of the translation vector \\f$T\\f$ : \\f$T=[T_0, T_1, T_2]^T\\f$ .\n        .   And the function can also compute the fundamental matrix F:\n        .   \n        .   \\f[F = cameraMatrix2^{-T}\\cdot E \\cdot cameraMatrix1^{-1}\\f]\n        .   \n        .   Besides the stereo-related information, the function can also perform a full calibration of each of\n        .   the two cameras. However, due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space and noise in the\n        .   input data, the function can diverge from the correct solution. If the intrinsic parameters can be\n        .   estimated with high accuracy for each of the cameras individually (for example, using\n        .   #calibrateCamera ), you are recommended to do so and then pass @ref CALIB_FIX_INTRINSIC flag to the\n        .   function along with the computed intrinsic parameters. Otherwise, if all the parameters are\n        .   estimated at once, it makes sense to restrict some parameters, for example, pass\n        .    @ref CALIB_SAME_FOCAL_LENGTH and @ref CALIB_ZERO_TANGENT_DIST flags, which is usually a\n        .   reasonable assumption.\n        .   \n        .

If the flag is set,\n        .   the function makes the principal points of each camera have the same pixel coordinates in the\n        .   rectified views. And if the flag is not set, the function may still shift the images in the\n        .   horizontal or vertical direction (depending on the orientation of epipolar lines) to maximize the\n        .   useful image area.\n        .   @param alpha Free scaling parameter.

See below the screenshot from the stereo_calib.cpp sample. Some red horizontal lines pass through\n        .   the corresponding image regions. This means that the images are well rectified, which is what most\n        .   stereo correspondence algorithms rely on. The green rectangles are roi1 and roi2 .
